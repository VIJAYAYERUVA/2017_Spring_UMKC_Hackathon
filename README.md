### Use Case U13: Food Game: Junk or Healthy?

Conduct the following tasks on your datasets using any machine learning tools (TensorFlow, Spark MLlib, Weka, R, ect). Write about your models and evaluate your results (datasets, accuracy, etc).
1. Classification: Junk Food? Healthy Food? (image based classificaiton)
2. Sentiment Classification of Food Reviews:  predict the score of food reviews on a scale of 1 to 5 
3. Predict calories in junk food an healthy food
Write a moble or web-based app for the food game.	


### Solution

Developed a mobile gaming application which will capture the image and send it as input to the deep learning model. Deep learning model will process the image and displays the output with name of the image, calories related to the image, and rating of the image.
